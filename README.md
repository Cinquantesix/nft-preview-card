## My process

My objectif (before the start)

I would like to try to:

- Have a better way to use scss features
- Add BEM classes to my html

I'll also try to to the challenge in less than 2 hours.

(after end)

- The development took me 3h
- I had some trouble between grid and flex for some content placement
- I tried to have more reflection before beginning to be sure to develop the better solution. I think it was what I didn't have for last projects and I really underestimated the step.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SCSS
- BEM Methodology

### What I learned

I learn a lot in BEM and SCSS variable. Also some tricks in Grid and 

### Continued development

I will try to add more variables and automatism fot SCSS to be sure to have less repetition. For BEM, I think I need to have ve more specific with the words a choose for my classes.
